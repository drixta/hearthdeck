Hearthstone deck builder

This is a work in progress web app. Hearthdeck uses mongodb for database, express.js for backend and backbone.js for front-end.

Heroku app is at: http://hearthdeck.herokuapp.com/  . Currently running at 1 web dyno so it might take a while to load the site.

###Deckbuilder: 
- Add cards count exp 30/30
- Change the save function to commit as POST request once
- Lots of design adjustments
- Add missing cards
- Add description editor

###Deckviewer:

- Add Deck search function
- Add Deck search view in the front-page
- Add Description viewer
- Design adjustments

If anyone willing to contribute, please feel free to email me :D.
